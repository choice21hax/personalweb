# Website Development Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the steps to create a minimalistic website to host URLs for accessing nodes, a file upload feature with size limits, and a software page for open-source software. The site will feature a black-and-white theme with custom logos for navigation links.

## 1. Project Setup

- **Choose a Technology Stack**:
  - Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or a framework like React or Vue.js).
  - Backend: Node.js with Express or a simple PHP server.
  - Database: Use a lightweight database like SQLite or a file storage system for uploads.

- **Initialize the Project**:
  - Create a project directory and initialize with Git.
  - Set up a basic file structure:
    ```
    /project-directory
      ├── /public
      │   ├── index.html
      │   ├── style.css
      │   └── script.js
      ├── /uploads
      ├── /softwares
      ├── server.js (or index.php)
      └── README.md
    ```

## 2. Design and Layout

- **Wireframe the Layout**:
  - Create a simple layout sketch, including header, main content area, and footer.
  - Ensure navigation links are prominently displayed.

- **Define Page Structure**:
  - Home Page: Links to nodes, file upload, and software.
  - File Upload Page: Interface for users to upload files.
  - Software Page: List of open-source software links.

## 3. Implementing Navigation

- **Header with Custom Logos**:
  - Create an HTML header with navigation links:
    ```html
    <header>
      <a href="index.html"><img src="path/to/home-logo.png" alt="Home"></a>
      <a href="nodes.html"><img src="path/to/nodes-logo.png" alt="Nodes"></a>
      <a href="drive.html"><img src="path/to/drive-logo.png" alt="Drive"></a>
      <a href="software.html"><img src="path/to/github-logo.png" alt="GitHub"></a>
    </header>
    ```

## 4. Creating the Node URLs Page

- **Node URLs Page**:
  - Create a `nodes.html` page that lists URLs to access your nodes.
  - Use a simple list or grid layout for easy navigation.

## 5. File Upload Feature

- **Create File Upload Form**:
  - In `drive.html`, create an HTML form for file uploads:
    ```html
    <form id="uploadForm" action="/upload" method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">
      <input type="file" name="file" required>
      <button type="submit">Upload</button>
    </form>
    ```

- **Backend Handling**:
  - Set up backend logic to handle file uploads and enforce a 5GB limit using file size checks.
  - Store uploaded files in the `/uploads` directory.

## 6. Software Page for Open Source Software

- **Software Page**:
  - Create a `software.html` page listing various open-source software options.
  - Use cards or a table format to present the software with descriptions and links.

## 7. Styling the Website

- **CSS for Black and White Theme**:
  - Write CSS in `style.css` to ensure a clean, minimalistic design:
    ```css
    body {
      background-color: #fff;
      color: #000;
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
    }
    header {
      background-color: #000;
      color: #fff;
      padding: 10px;
      text-align: center;
    }
    a img {
      width: 30px; /* Adjust size as needed */
      margin: 0 10px;
    }
    ```

## 8. Testing

- **Cross-Browser Testing**:
  - Test the website across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  
- **File Upload Testing**:
  - Ensure file uploads function correctly and limit users to 5GB.

- **Responsiveness**:
  - Check the website on various devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## 9. Deployment

- **Choose a Hosting Service**:
  - Use a hosting provider that supports your chosen tech stack (e.g., Heroku, DigitalOcean, or a shared hosting service).

- **Deploy the Website**:
  - Upload your project files to the hosting service.
  - Configure the server settings for file uploads and routing.

- **Monitor and Maintain**:
  - Regularly check for user feedback and update the site as needed.

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a structured approach to creating a minimalistic website with the desired features. Regularly update your progress and adjust the plan as necessary. Good luck with your project!
